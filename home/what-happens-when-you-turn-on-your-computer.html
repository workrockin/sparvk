<p>When you press the power button on your computer it starts a series process collectively known as booting. Initially only a part of ROM storage is accessible to the computer. A small firmware program (BIOS) located on the ROM runs to perform a POST (power on self test) preparing the computer to access other parts of its hardware like ram and hard disk. </p>
<p>Following the POST setup a "bootstrap" loader is invoked to load the operating system kernel. The operating system kernel in turn runs a series of programs and services that allow you to use the computer hardware in the most effective manner. The kernel is, for example , responsible for starting network services, services needed to render the user interface, programs that manage user sessions and a bunch of background utility services. These utility services are often called system services because they are essential for your computer to work. </p>
<p>Most operating systems also allow you to define services that can be started during the boot time.  When you do this the kernel finds a list of user created services on the hard disk and instructs them to start , once the essential system services are up and running. While system services are necessary for the OS to run, user defined services are simply a convenient way to perform operations that might otherwise need to be started manually.  </p>
<p>The boot time, that is the time it takes for your computer to start after its switched on usually depends on how long it takes for your computer to start the system services as well as the user defined services on your machine.    </p>

<p>The firmware that starts the loading of operating system kernel is usually provided by the Original equipment manufacturer (OEM for short). Sometimes the OEM would also pre load an operating system on to the hardware that often drives up the <a href="reducing-your-it-costs-with-sparvk-pods.html">total cost of machine</a>.  As a buyer you can ask for a "DOS" machine to reduce the cost of equipment you purchase. With a DOS machine you won't have to pay the operating system expenses. </p>
<p>sparvk enabled operating systems can instruct the BIOS to load the os from a pendrive instead of a hard disk. This allows you to use a portable operating system that can run on any machine without modifying the data on the host system.  </p>
