<p>Most of the computer applications that you use on a daily basis store their data in
files. Programs for making documents, sheets, presentations they all have their own files.
How their files are created and how the data is stored is specific to a particular
program but they all store data in files. This much is common among them.</p>
<p>In a workspace you have to deal with documents all the time. You have to create
them. You have to get them approved . You have to request them from your colleagues.
Paperwork is central to all offices. Technology has certainly eased
the management of these documents but the process around sharing and collaboration
of these digital documents is still dated.</p>
<p>Documents are passed around as attachments in emails. Or moved about in thumbdrives. Or  maybe they are stored in the "cloud"</p>
<p>And there is nothing wrong with this. These are well understood
by everyone and they do their job well. But there is room for optimization
especially in cases where there is a need to have multiple
levels of engagement with a document.</p>
<p>We are looking for a technology that can help us:- </p>
<ol>
<li>Store multiple copies (or versions) of a document. Each version representing
a distinct snapshot in time that we can revert to in case that situation arises.   </li>
<li>Allow multiple participants to make changes to the files and log those changes
so that it can at any time be determined who made a particular change to the file.</li>
<li>Give the ability to users to create multiple branches of data
that can be submitted to an aprooving authority before the changes are merged in the central store.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a technology helps us by:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully dividing the work amongst various participants.</li>
<li>Providing backup and recovery options on any branch level as well as on a central level</li>
<li>Implementing an "executive workflow" where individual participants are free to make
changes to their own branches of work but it may only be added to the main branch after an approval.    </li>
</ol>
<p>Before we can implement such technology we must do some ground work.</p>
<h2>What can we do with files on computer?</h2>
<p>An unorganized desktop would be very hard to manage and therefore the first
thing that we need to take care of is the document organization.</p>
<p>It is well understood that files can be placed inside directories. But often
an unstructured approach to filing may lead to disorganization.
Here are a few quick tips to help  you organize your files better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a base work directory that will become the place where you store all your work related documents. Usually this working directory is the desktop or documents folder. But feel free to create a new one if you want. </li>
<li>In the working directory create multiple sub-directories as required.
For instance all the resumes of potential candidates can go inside a "resume directory" where as
all the financial information may be placed inside an accounts directory. It is usually a good idea
to name a sub-directory based upon the information it is going to store. Avoid giving generic names
like  "New Folder" and "New File" at all costs.</li>
<li>Be consistent. Once you have created a high level structure follow it rigorously. Review your
files on a regular basis to make sure that everything stays consistent according to the framework
you have created.     </li>
</ol>
<h2>Taking it a step further with a central repository</h2>
<p>For an individual a single well organized workstation is enough. With a well arranged
directory structure and a backup plan you are set. However in case of an organization
an additional complexity is added by</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of employees working together often on multiple projects simultaneously</li>
<li>People leaving and entering the organization creating the need for a prompt
handover of the work products as well as knowledge base required for the user to get
up to speed in his new work environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>A centralized repository makes this process easier by
removing the need for the data to be stored on a single machine. A new hire can quickly
set up his workstation on a different machine by pulling the data from a central server.</p>
<p>Further pre-prepared directory structures can be stored on a central store making it
easier for the workforce to follow a standard operating procedure. All changes made to branches can be
reviewed by the auditor or the immediate manager before approving them.  </p>
<h2>Support provided by sparvk for distributed workflows</h2>
<p>Sparvk pods provide portable opensource operating systems and tools that make everyday computing tasks easy.
Within each pod you have</p>
<ol>
<li>Tools necessary for document management and file organization, word processor, spreadsheets,
accounting and cash management application.  </li>
<li>Tools necessary to manage directories. Hierarchy of folders/sub folders with
access controls that determine the permission of the user on each level. For power users
there is the ability search for file trees from the desktop and even search for text
contained within the files. Filter them, sort through them and arrange them in multiple stacks by creating
pointers to directories all accessible from a single location.</li>
<li>Tools that allow version control and various revisions of file to be stored allowing
the user to switch back to a particular version of the document.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a pod is as simple as it can get. Pop in the pendrive into USB and switch on your
system to start your session. Or if you are looking for a greater performance simply install the operating
system along side your primary OS and switch between them as you need.   </p>
