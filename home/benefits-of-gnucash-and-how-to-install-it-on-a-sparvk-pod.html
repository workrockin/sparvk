<p>GNU cash is a powerful opensource accounting software that can help you keep books and track your taxes/loans and mortgages.  From the <a href="https://www.gnucash.org/">website</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“GnuCash is a personal and small-business financial-accounting software, freely licensed under the GPL. Designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible,GnuCash allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses. As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it is based on <strong>professional accounting</strong> principles to ensure balanced books and accurate reports.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Gnu cash is free and opensource it is packed full of features.  At its core its got a very powerful accounting system that supports: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Double Entry</strong>. "Every transaction must debit one account and credit others by an equal amount. This ensures the books balance: the difference between income and expenses exactly equals the sum of assets and liabilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A checkbook-style register</strong>. "It provides a custom, convenient and familiar interface to entering financial transactions. The register supports common checking and credit-card transactions, as well as income, stock and currency transactions. The following features are also provided:</p>
<p>• The ability to enter split transactions
• The ability to mark a transaction as cleared or reconciled
• Autofill of entered transactions
• The ability to display multiple accounts in a single register window
• A summary bar that displays all of the relevant account's balance information
• Many options to customize the appearance and the display style
" With a familiar interface and use of common accounting concepts your accounting team can quickly start using gnucash and experience an increased productivity in their work.   </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled Transactions</strong>. "You can create recurring transactions with a high level of customization of amounts and timeline. You can also set an automatic reminder when a transaction is due. An <strong>assistant</strong> that runs when GnuCash is started allows scheduled transactions to be postponed without canceling or entering them before the due date.
" With scheduled transactions you won't have to do manual, error prone, repeat entries. This feature is especially useful for property managers collecting rent on a regular basis. GNUCash gives you the ability to create scheduled entries  for your tenants that you can set and forget.  GNUCash keeps your books organized day after day, month after month, year after year.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reports &amp; Graphs</strong>. "GnuCash also comes complete with a full suite of standard and customizeable reports, such as balance sheets, profit and loss, portfolio valuation and many more." You can view the performance of your accounts over a period of time. Reports and graphs are especially useful for projecting your investments.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Statement Reconciliation</strong>. "Account reconciliation allows the user to compare the transactions entered in an account against a bank statement. This operation is very useful to spot untracked transactions or data entry errors and ensure that your books match the bank's. The GnuCash reconcile tool with running reconciled and cleared balances makes reconciling against bank statements an easy task." Reconciliation feature can also be used as the basis of a <a href="introduction-to-collaborative-workflows-on-desktop.html">collaborative</a> accounting workflow. For example in a bank where books maintained by the teller are audited by the auditor and signed off by the manager before they are marked as reconciled. The reconciliation feature in short can be used in any scenario where there needs to be multiple levels of verification or multiple levels of checking before an entry can be committed in the transaction.  GNUCash reconciliation forms, in other words the basis of an accounting workflow.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Income/Expense Account Types</strong>. "Income/Expense Account Types (Categories) allow you to categorize your cash flow. When used properly with the double-entry feature and equity accounts, these enable you to generate reports, such as Profit &amp; Loss, that plain-vanilla systems cannot handle." Income/Expense accounts can not only be used to track personal finances but they can also be used to provide a cash report service to your clients. All reports in GNUCash can be exported and emailed to concerned parties. GNUCash can handle multiple accounts from a single location and generate separate reports for each one o the accounts that it handles.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Small business accounting</strong>. "With Customer and Vendor tracking, Jobs, Invoicing and Bill Payment, and Tax and Billing Terms. Using A/Receivable and A/Payable accounts you can even manage payrolls for your employees. GnuCash gives you also a tool to manage your business' budget so that you can easily plan your financial strategy."  GnuCash is flexible enough to handle accounts at organizational, branch and department levels. How you choose to use it is up to you!    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Currencies</strong>. "Different accounts can be denominated in different currencies. Currency movements between accounts are fully balanced when double-entry is enabled." GNUCash is perfect if your organization has got multinational presence or if you're a remote worker having clients in many different countries.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Stock and Mutual Fund Protfolios</strong>. "Track stocks individually (one per account) or in portfolio of accounts (a group of accounts that can be displayed together)." Combine this with the powerful reporting feature to project your stocks on a graph and see how they have performed. </li>
</ol>
<p>10 . <strong>Online stock and mutual fund quotes</strong>. "Get Stock &amp; Mutual Fund quotes from various web sites, update portfolio automatically. Additional pricing sources are added regularly."</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p><strong>QIM and OFX import</strong>.  " If you are migrating from other financial software, GnuCash can import Intuit® Quicken® QIF files using a practical assistant. GnuCash is also the first free software application to support the OFX (Open Financial Exchange) protocol that many banks and financial services are starting to use. A transaction matching system ensures that duplicate transactions are accurately recognized and automatically deleted during file import."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> HCBI support</strong>. "GnuCash is the first free software application to support the German Home Banking Computer Information protocol, allowing German users to perform statement download and initiate bank transfers and direct debits."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple languages</strong>. "GnuCash handles internationalized dates and currencies. The application's menus and popups have been translated to 50 languages, including Chinese, Danish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, and British English. Documentation is available in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish."   GNUCash can be understood and operated by people in many countries leading to less investment spend in training of workforce. Perfect if you have an international team or are planning to set one up. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transaction finder</strong>. "A powerful transaction query dialogue can help you quickly locate a needle in a haystack." Powerful search capabilities means you can log all your transactions into GNUCash and without worrying about how to retrieve one in case you need it. Compared to storing paper accounts and receipts this is a much better solution. GNUCash encourages digitization of your records by making it easier to not only save but also retrieve records quickly and easily.      </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check printing</strong>. "Checks may be printed in standard formats on common check stocks. A customization GUI allows custom check layouts to be developed."  This is especially useful features for small business (franchise owners, restaurants, retail shops etc) where you have to pay to a lot of vendors. Check printing can automate the laborious and error prone process of writing checks by hand.  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage and loan repayment assistant</strong>. "A guided dialogue for setting up loan payments as scheduled transactions."</li>
</ol>
<p>17 <strong>Help and documentation</strong>. "GnuCash is very well documented: along with the application Manual, new users can take full advantage of the Tutorial and Concepts guide. This document gives background information on accounting principles and how they are reflected in GnuCash with many practical examples described step by step." GNUCash guide comes built in with the application so you can always look it up in case you feel lost about something. </p>
