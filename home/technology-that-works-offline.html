<p>All applications on internet are dependent on several layers services and expect them to be operational all the time. Such an expectation is unreasonable. Things go wrong. Networks get congested. Data centers break down. Redundancy helps but only to an extent. At best as a service provider you can ensure your own level of performance. You have no control over the performance of the client networks. </p>
<p>Internet is connected. Internet applications are not simply dependent on a single entity.</p>
<p>The applications delivered via internet has to satisfy two levels of availability. The application service provider has to ensure the availability of their services. Meaning their servers must be up and running so that when a user requests their application they can fulfill the request. The internet service provider on the other hand has to ensure the availability of an internet connection when the user makes the request for an application that request can actually reach the service provider. </p>
<p>This does pose a few problems for us. By consuming online applications we are limited to hot spots of connectivity. And even here there is no guarantee that connectivity will always be a 100%. How many times a network congestion has disrupted the performance of your workforce? </p>
<p>By confining ourselves to connected hot spots we limit our reach. People have to travel to a single location to perform tasks that could have been just as effectively been executed from anywhere else. A few such workplaces lead to an overburden on our resources.  Not just IT resources but others as well. Congestion on roads for instance. </p>
<p>Also given this trend of remote work environments (where your people want to work from anywhere) it becomes critical for us to build systems that can work everywhere. In all situations. Everytime. It is important to select systems that can work in a disconnected environment. </p>
<p>Once you know where to look and what to look for you’ll find that a lot of work has been done on technology that works offline. You use it all the time yourself. While your facebook app might require an internet connection to work, the calculator on your phone works without an internet connection. Your alarms don't be connected. Neither does your camera app. You might be using a lot of bandwidth on your phone but you don’t need an internet connection to turn it on (yet!). </p>
<p>On your desktop you got spreadsheets that work offline, you have documents, files of all kind that are accessible offline. If you think about it the majority of computer technology, that you use regularly, works without needing any kind of network connectivity. </p>
<p>But some of these technologies are expensive. Operating systems and office tools can cost a fortune per user. The big move to internet is basically an exercise in cost reduction. What if there can be technology that is <a href="reducing-your-it-costs-with-sparvk-pods.html">just as cheap</a> but also works offline? </p>
<p>Sparvk is  a portable distribution (pod) of opensource operating system and tools. Buy it once and do what you like. No complex licensing or renewal fees. It works 100% of the time. Even when there is no network connectivity. </p>
