<h1>What is sparvk?</h1>
<p>Sparvk is a Portable Distribution of Operating System Software and tools (POD for short). It packages an operating system and a suite of computer programs on a usb stick that make it easy for a user perform everyday tasks on his computer. Some of its features include:- </p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to run it off a pendrive. Works on any computer that supports USB boot. Once booted you can browse the internet. Work on documents , perform accounting task, draw, design or use any number of applications that come packed in/are <a href="about.html#apps">compatible</a> with the system. With sparvk you get a fully functional,feature rich desktop environment. </li>
<li>Comes with a snap mode where all data is automatically deleted when the computer is turned off. Ideal for performing sensitive operations that you don't want to be stored.</li>
<li>Support for dual boot. For better performance you can install sparvk alongside your primary operating system on the hard disk. Choosing which one you want to use at the time of booting. Or better yet switch to sparvk completely. </li>
<li>Spark is secure by default.  The design of the system makes it difficult for malicious programs to run minimizing the need for complex antivirus software that can slow down the system. </li>
<li>Sparvk is lightweight, fast and open source. The entire os runs in about 500 - 800 MB of RAM making it possible to run it off a USB stick even on dated hardware.  When you order sparvk you get a preloaded pendrive that you can pop in any computer that supports a USB boot and start your session.</li>
</ul>
<p>So order now to put a bit of Sparvk in your system. </p>
<p>Oh and sparvk is pronounced as spark. The <strong>v</strong>  ,that has some how sneaked in just after the <strong>r</strong> and just before the <strong>k</strong>,
is silent........or is it?</p>
<h1>FAQS</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>What operating systems run inside a sparvk pod?</strong></p>
<p>A sparvk pod runs on a debian based operating system. Like debian itself, light wiethg ubuntu derivations like Xubuntu, Lubuntu etc. ANY software that comes in a sparvk pod is open source and subject to opensource liscences of the respctive OS distributions and packages.  </p>
<p><strong>Do you make the Operating System and other software that comes packaged with the sparvk pod?</strong></p>
<p>No. All of the software that is installed on a sparvk pod is opensource. It is built and maintained by a community of developers across the world and released for free. Free for anyone to use and modify their work as they see fit. A sparvk pod simply packages the content and makes it available in a pendrive/hard-disk . </p>
<p><strong>How many apps are available?</strong> <a id="apps"> </a></p>
<p>There are over 50k packages and applications that can run with the sparvk pod. Unfortunately it is difficult to fit them all on a usb stick. Instead you can download the ones you need from the built in software store. The base distribution comes with all the tools that necessary to perform everday tasks. If you find something lacking you can always get it from the store.    </p>
<p><strong>Does sparvk need internet to work?</strong></p>
<p>No. sparvk is an offline first portable distribution of operating system. It does not need an internet connection to work. Although there are certain applications that work on the internet. (Mozilla firefox web browser for example) </p>
<p>The operating system itself and most of the applications that come packaged with it will happily work in a disconnected setting. You may need to use internet when installing new applications or performing a system upgrade. Besides that it is all offline. </p>
<p><strong>Are sparvk files compatible with other operating systems?</strong> </p>
<p>On a sparvk enabled system there are many applications used. Each of these applications save their data in a particular file format.  As long as the application is installable on the OS of your choice the files should be compatible across systems. Most applications on sparvk are portable (meaning they can be installed on any system)  </p>
<p>Across applications (thatis file created using one application and modified using another application) as is most commonly the case with Libre office suite and MS office the files are compatible as long as they are saved with proper extensions. </p>
<p>Since all of the applications that come with sparvk are open-source care has been taken by developers to make sure that there is no  lock in of any kind. Many applications are also designed to support cross compatibility. The design and drawing applications for example accept not only proprietary formats as input but also allow saving of files in these formats so that they can be used by other programs. </p>
<p>It is very hard to give a precise answer to this topic as there are a lot of variables involved. But for the most part you'll find a high degree of compatibility between files created using sparvk systems and other programs.</p>
