<p>Organization of the data on your computer requires discipline and consistency.
But often due to a tight schedule "housekeeping" gets de-prioritized. Things pile
up. Files accumulate. Folders stack on and before you know it your desktop is a
mess like your store in the basement. But while you can simply ignore your basement you have
to work with your desktop daily. </p>
<p>Every-time you power on your computer you step
in to disorder, chaos. You can't say for sure if your resume is placed in "new
folder" or in  "new folder 6" ? And when you come to think about it was it new
folder on the "Desktop" or new folder in the "Documents"? Frantically clicking
directories take you deeper and deeper into a maze until you find yourself
trapped.  </p>
<p>It is in times like these that one looks up into the sky seeking some divine
guidance to show us the path towards salvation. You wait for a cuckoo to
whisper something sweet in your ear. A melody that takes away all your troubles
and leave you replenished,recharged. Ready to walk again. You wait for a song. But
what do you get instead? Crows. Mocking you. Kreank! Kaaaw!! Kraowww!!!</p>
<p>And it is in times like this that you become aware of a cold sensation in your
spine. You know that you have done something wrong. "CONFESS!!" the crows
screech. Admit that you were wrong.  </p>
<p>A just as you see the pack cornering you something incredible happens. Something
bright. Something that can't quite be put in to words. A flash of light. A sense
of warmth.
Fresh breeze of air. And a clean desktop.
No more scattered files. No more deep spiraling directories.
Everything in order. </p>

<h2>How sparvk brings order to your desktop?</h2>
<p>By default a sparvk pod comes with a fixed desktop view. Meaning although you
can place useful apps on the screen like a clock or a calendar but you
can't create new files and folders. There is a separate place for all that and
to access it you have to click on your applications menu and navigate to your
home directory. Here you'd find a traditional view of your file system that
allows you to work on files, save them and move them around. </p>
<p>The idea behind this default  configuration is to help you keep your
<a href="introduction-to-collaborative-workflows-on-desktop.html">desktop organized</a>.
By moving all the files and folders behind an application menu you
get a minimal structure for your documents. They won't be scattered all over
the place. </p>
<p><img alt="opensource file searching" src="http://sparvk.workrock.in/user/pages/01.home/an-uncluttered-desktop-experience/search.png" /></p>
<p>You can easily find any file using the built in search capabilities. You can
open directories in new tabs within the same window giving you a way to have
multiple folders open at the same time. You can move around files
by opening split view panes. Dragging the folder from one pane and dropping it
in another. Each pane itself supports multiple tabs.<br />
You can <a href="remote-file-management-and-backup-with-sparvk.html">backup your files</a> on a remote server so all your documents are
safe. </p>
<p>On sparvk pods when you turn on your computer you feel in total control. </p>
