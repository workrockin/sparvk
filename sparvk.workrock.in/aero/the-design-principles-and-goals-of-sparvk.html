<p>sparvk is an opensource distribution of operating systems. Every unit of sparvk is assembled keeping the following principles in mind:- </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>C</strong>onsistent. Sparvk applications should provide a consistent experience to all the users in a team. Consistency is essential to reduce the amount of effort that must be spend to train new staff. Manuals prepared once may be used for years on end without becoming outdated. Updates to software must not break existing workflows. Sparvk aims to become the foundational technology in your organization. On top of which you can create your own business rules and systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>O</strong>ffline. Applications should work in spotty network conditions. We look building systems that can operate in disconnected environments.  A user should not need Internet connectivity to work on documents. They should be able to access their data regardless of the network connectivity. An internet connection may enhance the experience by allowing them to install updates and new applications but in no way should it be a necessity for doing actual work.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>P</strong>ortable. Consistency is of no use if it can only be achieved in perfectly staged conditions. Sparvk systems run anywhere. On a server. On your desktop. On your laptop. On your mobile. Through a pendrive. Through an SD card. Or installed on a hard disk. The resources available on a machine will determine how fluidly a sparvk system can run but the core of should be able to run anywhere.  A sparvk system with all the bells and whistles can operate under 1 gb of ram. Granted you won’t be able to open 50 applications at once but you’ll still be able to perform basic functions, get things done.   </li>
</ol>
<p>Besides these fundamental rules there are a few other principles that influence our work </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Security. Sparvk systems are secure by default. You won’t need to install any antivirus programs. You won’t have to worry about your privacy. You can encrypt entire hard disks so that as long as you protect your master password your data is secure. Even if it gets stolen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User isolation. Although a sparvk system can be used by <a href="../home/users-and-sessions-in-sparvk-pod.html">multiple accounts</a> at once every user will get his own work environment that can’t be tresspassed by other users of the system. Unless you happen to be the administrator every user will only get to see and interact with their own data.</p>
</li>
<li>Gentle on its users. Technology is useless if it can’t be utilized effectively. We build technology so people can use it to simplify their lives. To perform their duties at work more effectively, to be more productive. With sparvk you’ll find yourself in a control, in a state of flow. And if, in the unlikely event,  you ever get stuck you’ll find help from the online community. Forums, youtube videos, blogs, facebook and whatsapp groups, live chats. Plenty of people happy to help you out. A level customer support that is unmatched.     </li>
</ul>
<p>Although we have a set of guidelines that we follow while working on our technology that does not mean that you as a <a href="supplier-distribution-kits.html">distributor partner</a> or as a customer have to honor or even follow these guidelines. And while you have to take care of not violating open source licenses on which sparvk is built , as a user of you are free to do with it as you please. </p>
