For every trip organized you have to arrange for transport, stay and sightseeing, in addition to other misc. expenses like food. The financial transactions often involves back and forth of commissions to not only travel agents but also other parties involved in the journey of a tourist.  <\/p>\n<p>For a complicated process that requires you to keep track of multiple micro transactions you need an accounting tool that can help you keep your books organized . sparvk pods come with built in support to handle all the accounting requirements for travel companies. Here are a list of things that you'll be able to do with a sparvk pod's travel accounting software:-  <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create customer accounts. You can create accounts not only for individuals but also for corporate travelers. Against each customer account you can create invoices, print them, reconcile them and process payments against them. <\/li>\n<li>Create vendor accounts for your travel service suppliers. Vendor accounts allow you to bill each supplier separately. So for instance if you have a travel package that requires the services of many vendors (eg: hotels, airlines, transport) you can create bills for them separately. The bills created can be charged back to your customers. Or they can be paid by you and invoiced to the customer later.  Vendors also allow you to create credit notes to compensate for bills that were charged incorrectly. <\/li>\n<li>Create employee accounts. Running a travel company is not a one person job. No doubt you'd have your own staff helping you out with the bookings. Or arranging for pickup and drops. The travel accounting applications allow you to create  expense vouchers on behalf of employees. So that if you have any field agents for example you can reimburse them for any spending that they do for travelers (like purchasing food or water bottles or paying toll tax) <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To make things simpler the trael accounting application comes with a list of common travel expenses built in. So you won't have to spend too much time in data entry and get straight to doing things that matter. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"travel accounting software\" src=\"\/user\/pages\/03.uses\/accounting-for-travel-companies\/notebook-614213_960_720.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The business side of the travel accounting software would help you manage your most common accounting tasks. Besides that sparvk travel accounting  can help you <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create scheduled transactions for recurring payments (like salaries or rent etc) <\/li>\n<li>View reports and charts that give you a high level overview of the company performance. <\/li>\n<li>Create and track quotations. Create budgets. Manage multiple books from a single application. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A good accountant can help you manage your books effectively.  sparvk pod's accounting system makes sure that your bookkeepers have the technology that they can trust on to make their life easier. <\/p>\n<h1>Try it you'll like it<\/h1>"},{"title":"An operating system for housing professionals","date_published":"2018-12-14","date_modified":"2018-12-14","id":"http:\/\/sparvk.workrock.in\/uses\/an-operating-system-for-housing-professionals%20","url":"http:\/\/sparvk.workrock.in\/uses\/an-operating-system-for-housing-professionals%20","author":{"name":"Your Name"},"content_html":"\n<p>Property management is no easy task.

Whether you're a doctor or a lawyer or an teacher you will need to use computers for your day to day tasks.  The actual use may be as simple as responding to emails or it may be as complex as designing drafts for mechanical components. Proficiency in computers means an increased productivity in your work and improved prospects of getting a job. <\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately though many of the proprietary systems that  are used in the industry today are out of reach to the young people due to their high proprietary costs.  While a fledgling business may be able to afford these tools is difficult for educational institutes , students and hobbyists to be able to pay for the high licencing fees. <\/p>\n<p>Another problem is presented by the shared hardware. It may be that a single computer lab has to provide access to multiple students studying different courses. A mechanical engineering student might be using the same lab that a electronic engineering student does. From the point of view of hardware it is cost effective to share the resources.  After all its not like a workstation is occupied all day. Such a sharing model does indeed lead to a more efficient utilization of the machines. But when it comes to the applications running on a system things do get a bit unmanageable. <\/p>\n<p>As a college expands by adding more disciplines the strain on hardware increases. While the ME student might want to use CAD tools, electronic engineering student would want to use tools for designing chips or for simulating an electonic circuit.<\/p>\n<p>Each tool comes with its own quirks. Having multiple such tools on the same machine without any logical separation between access leads to confusion or in severe cases a data loss. We not only need multiple people to use the same hardware but we also need keep the data and applications for each user separate.   <\/p>\n<p>As a rundown of what we've discussed so far is we need tools that are:- <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Free and non proprietary to save costs<\/li>\n<li>Can be used on shared hardware resources for efficient machine utilization  <\/li>\n<li>Still provides an personalized experience to the user to prevent any confusion and data loss.      <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>How sparvk helps?<\/h2>\n<p>Sparvk is a portable distribution of debian based opensource operating system.
