<p>One of the great things about computer technology is that once you set it up it can be replicated consistently across any number of machines. It works predictably, reliably and  regularly.  Predictability and regularity are two key requirements for the success of any franchise. </p>
<p>As a franchiser you want your franchisees to be able to implement key process necessary to provide a level of service that is up to the standards of your brand. New franchises face a different set of challenges that must be addressed to ensure first their survival and then a smooth functioning of day to day operations. These challenges are:- </p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding and satisfying customer demand day in and day out. </li>
<li>Making sure that they well provisioned to satisfy the demands of their customers. Work that happens behind the scenes becomes just as important as the work that happens on the front lines.  </li>
<li>Tracking some key metrics that indicate the health of their business. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now all businesses face these challenges at some point in their life. From a franchise however the expectations are a lot higher due to the brand name  associated and the licensing fees involved. What can you do as the owner of a franchise to overcome these obstacles? </p>
<p>A lot of things. To list a few</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement digital accounting system across each franchise setting a standard bookkeeping practice in for all the franchises. </li>
<li>Create self learning  programs that can increase the on boarding speed for new hires which can be critical during the initial stages of the business. </li>
<li>Building systems that can track the key performance indicators and communicate these metrics with the stakeholders.  </li>
</ol>
<p>The list can go on and one. </p>
<p>Technology can help in the implementation of these processes on behalf of a franchiser to help them get into business a lot quicker. However for a technology like this to be adopted it must be consistent, well understood so that it feels natural to their operators. </p>

<p>Sparvk provides a solid foundation on which you can base the IT infrastructure of your franchise. </p>
<p>Sparvk pods require a minimal hardware to run (in fact it can run off a USB stick). The opensource components of sparvk are well tested and accepted by the community . For a franchise sparvk provides </p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="../home/benefits-of-gnucash-and-how-to-install-it-on-a-sparvk-pod.html">accounting module</a> that allows you to track income, expenses, liabilities, assets and equity. The application is easy to learn and comes with a in built manual that you can refer in case you get stuck. </li>
<li>Calendering components to keep your entire staff organized. Documents and spreadsheets to keep all your data in neatly packed in one place. </li>
<li>Communication tools. Email clients to handle all your customer support tickets. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sparvk has no licensing fees so you don't have to pay an yearly "maintenance" in order to keep the system running. You get it once and its yours forever. As you expand your business your <a href="../home/reducing-your-it-costs-with-sparvk-pods.html">total cost of ownership</a> for the IT infrastructure will actually go down.</p>
