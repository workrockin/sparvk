<p>The accounting in travel companies can get quite complex due to a number of third party vendors involved. For every trip organized you have to arrange for transport, stay and sightseeing, in addition to other misc. expenses like food. The financial transactions often involves back and forth of commissions to not only travel agents but also other parties involved in the journey of a tourist.  </p>
<p>For a complicated process that requires you to keep track of multiple micro transactions you need an accounting tool that can help you keep your books organized . sparvk pods come with built in support to handle all the accounting requirements for travel companies. Here are a list of things that you'll be able to do with a sparvk pod's travel accounting software:-  </p>
<ol>
<li>Create customer accounts. You can create accounts not only for individuals but also for corporate travelers. Against each customer account you can create invoices, print them, reconcile them and process payments against them. </li>
<li>Create vendor accounts for your travel service suppliers. Vendor accounts allow you to bill each supplier separately. So for instance if you have a travel package that requires the services of many vendors (eg: hotels, airlines, transport) you can create bills for them separately. The bills created can be charged back to your customers. Or they can be paid by you and invoiced to the customer later.  Vendors also allow you to create credit notes to compensate for bills that were charged incorrectly. </li>
<li>Create employee accounts. Running a travel company is not a one person job. No doubt you'd have your own staff helping you out with the bookings. Or arranging for pickup and drops. The travel accounting applications allow you to create  expense vouchers on behalf of employees. So that if you have any field agents for example you can reimburse them for any spending that they do for travelers (like purchasing food or water bottles or paying toll tax) </li>
</ol>
<p>To make things simpler the trael accounting application comes with a list of common travel expenses built in. So you won't have to spend too much time in data entry and get straight to doing things that matter. </p>
