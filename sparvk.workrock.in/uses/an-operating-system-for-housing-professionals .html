<p>Property management is no easy task. You have to deal with a 100 things, all at
once. Not only are you responsible for daily upkeep of your property but you
also have to keep all your residents happy and engaged. A 100% satisfaction rate
is something that is difficult to achieve. No matter how good you are at your
job you will miss things. We understand the challenges involved in housing. </p>
<p>To help you become more effective in overcoming these challenges we've built
sparvk a portable distribution of opensource operating system that comes with:- </p>
<ul>
<li>A personal information manager that allows you to keep all your contacts in
one place.</li>
<li>Calendering application that lets you schedule your most important tasks by
the day, month and year.Never miss an appointment again. </li>
<li>A <a href="../home/creating-invoices-with-gnu-cash.html">digital accounts book</a> allowing you to manage your cash assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. You can even schedule rent invoices for your
tenants ahead of time so that you don't miss a collection. </li>
</ul>
<p>Best of all you won't have to depend upon an Internet connection to access your
data. Our selected applications for property managers work <a href="../home/technology-that-works-offline.html">offline</a>. So you
can find what you need even if there is no internet connection.</p>
<p><img alt="software tools for real estate professionals" src="../images/4/7/d/b/e/47dbe72da55fb72cb816aa4af0ef915a6c06c836-realestate.jpeg" /></p>
<p>As a property manager you have to work with documents all the time. Whether it
is the Ids or it is the agreements you have to keep records
of all transactions. Filing, tagging, archiving is a very time consuming task
that often detracts you from more pressing issues like servicing your existing
customers or working towards acquiring new ones. </p>
<p>sparvk helps you digitize your records and save them as files on a computer.
The sparvk file system comes with tools that allow you to classify your files
in directories. Automatically back them up on a remote host. Multiple levels of
security that allows you to :- </p>
<ol>
<li>Restrict the access to files and directories</li>
<li>Encrypt the files on the hard drive. </li>
<li>Share a single computer with <a href="../home/users-and-sessions-in-sparvk-pod.html">multiple users</a> reducing the costs of your
IT infrastructure. </li>
</ol>
<p>With desktop publishing apps you can create marketing campaigns that can be
attached as a part of an email news letter or sent out to your prospects as
brochures ( <em>In one study it was found that direct mail brochures are still the
number one method from which prospects source product information </em>). </p>
<p>Spreadsheets allow you to manage all kinds of data. Whether it is to keep a
record of all the queries from your residents.
Or it is to note down a list of all the prospects
spreadsheets provide you with a familiar interface for tracking your data.
Something that anyone can use without formal training. </p>
<p>This is where the operating system is at its best. As a property manager you've
got more important things to do that fiddling about with the computer.
When you boot sparvk you'll find something that is familiar and yet more powerful than
anything you've used. </p>
<p>sparvk is a portable distribution of opensource operating systems and tools.
You don't have to pay any recurring licensing fees to use it. sparvk can
support your team of housing professionals across the entire portfolio of
properties by providing a standardized enjoyable computing experience. </p>
