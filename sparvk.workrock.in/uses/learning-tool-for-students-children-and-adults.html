<p>A basic computer education is required today to effectively work in any discipline. Whether you're a doctor or a lawyer or an teacher you will need to use computers for your day to day tasks.  The actual use may be as simple as responding to emails or it may be as complex as designing drafts for mechanical components. Proficiency in computers means an increased productivity in your work and improved prospects of getting a job. </p>
<p>Unfortunately though many of the proprietary systems that  are used in the industry today are out of reach to the young people due to their high proprietary costs.  While a fledgling business may be able to afford these tools is difficult for educational institutes , students and hobbyists to be able to pay for the high licencing fees. </p>
<p>Another problem is presented by the shared hardware. It may be that a single computer lab has to provide access to multiple students studying different courses. A mechanical engineering student might be using the same lab that a electronic engineering student does. From the point of view of hardware it is cost effective to share the resources.  After all its not like a workstation is occupied all day. Such a sharing model does indeed lead to a more efficient utilization of the machines. But when it comes to the applications running on a system things do get a bit unmanageable. </p>
<p>As a college expands by adding more disciplines the strain on hardware increases. While the ME student might want to use CAD tools, electronic engineering student would want to use tools for designing chips or for simulating an electonic circuit.</p>
<p>Each tool comes with its own quirks. Having multiple such tools on the same machine without any logical separation between access leads to confusion or in severe cases a data loss. We not only need multiple people to use the same hardware but we also need keep the data and applications for each user separate.   </p>
<p>As a rundown of what we've discussed so far is we need tools that are:- </p>
<ol>
<li>Free and non proprietary to save costs</li>
<li>Can be used on shared hardware resources for efficient machine utilization  </li>
<li>Still provides an personalized experience to the user to prevent any confusion and data loss.      </li>
</ol>
<h2>How sparvk helps?</h2>
<p>Sparvk is a portable distribution of debian based opensource operating system. It is opensource (free / non proprietary / community supported) that can run off a pendrive. </p>
<p>Advantages? Well here you go:-  </p>
<ol>
<li>Extremely flexible in how you run the system. Create multiple usb sticks and assign it to students to run it live.  Install multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single computer.  Run it with other operating systems. The choices are unlimited here. </li>
<li>A simplified per user directory partitioning giving each user of the system his own workspace on the system. So even if you go with one "operating system per computer" multiple you can create multiple users for the system. </li>
<li>Thousands of packages available free of cost. Any imaginable problem you can think of there'd be a package already for that.  </li>
</ol>
<h2>What kind of learning tools are available?</h2>
<p>All kinds! </p>
<p>Looking for CAD tools? Try free cad or libre cad
Looking for floor planning tools? How about sweet home 3d?
Want some graphic designing software? Well there's inkscape and gimp and blender and well a lot more.
Want to try some programming? Choose your language pthon, lua, c, java and more
Interested in getting your hands dirty with some AI tools . We've got you covered here too. </p>

<p>Sparvk makes for an excellent tool for learning computers because its cheap, reusable and portable. And whats more not only can you use it to learn computer you can also use it to learn from computers .</p>
<p>YES!</p>
<p>Programs that come packaged in with sparvk have been built upon decades of work by community. And the people who have built these applications have compiled in a lot of knowledge into their software. Say you've always been interested in floor planning but you never knew where to start. No problem simply download a floor planning app like sweethome 3d and follow along with their in built examples. Then take it a step forward by planning your room. Then your home. And then your city. Share your plan files with other people. let them simulate your designs on their own computer and feel the magic of your design.   </p>
<p>With sparvk there's an endless list of things that you can do. Your only limit is your imagination. </p>
