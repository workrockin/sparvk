Every unit of sparvk is assembled keeping the following principles in mind:- <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>C<\/strong>onsistent. Sparvk applications should provide a consistent experience to all the users in a team. Consistency is essential to reduce the amount of effort that must be spend to train new staff. Manuals prepared once may be used for years on end without becoming outdated. Updates to software must not break existing workflows. Sparvk aims to become the foundational technology in your organization. On top of which you can create your own business rules and systems.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>O<\/strong>ffline. Applications should work in spotty network conditions. We look building systems that can operate in disconnected environments.  A user should not need Internet connectivity to work on documents. They should be able to access their data regardless of the network connectivity. An internet connection may enhance the experience by allowing them to install updates and new applications but in no way should it be a necessity for doing actual work.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>P<\/strong>ortable. Consistency is of no use if it can only be achieved in perfectly staged conditions. Sparvk systems run anywhere. On a server. On your desktop. On your laptop. On your mobile. Through a pendrive. Through an SD card. Or installed on a hard disk. The resources available on a machine will determine how fluidly a sparvk system can run but the core of should be able to run anywhere.  A sparvk system with all the bells and whistles can operate under 1 gb of ram. Granted you won\u2019t be able to open 50 applications at once but you\u2019ll still be able to perform basic functions, get things done.   <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Besides these fundamental rules there are a few other principles that influence our work <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Security. Sparvk systems are secure by default. You won\u2019t need to install any antivirus programs. You won\u2019t have to worry about your privacy. You can encrypt entire hard disks so that as long as you protect your master password your data is secure. Even if it gets stolen.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>User isolation. Although a sparvk system can be used by <a href=\"\/home\/users-and-sessions-in-sparvk-pod\">multiple accounts<\/a> at once every user will get his own work environment that can\u2019t be tresspassed by other users of the system. Unless you happen to be the administrator every user will only get to see and interact with their own data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Gentle on its users. Technology is useless if it can\u2019t be utilized effectively. We build technology so people can use it to simplify their lives. To perform their duties at work more effectively, to be more productive. With sparvk you\u2019ll find yourself in a control, in a state of flow. And if, in the unlikely event,  you ever get stuck you\u2019ll find help from the online community. Forums, youtube videos, blogs, facebook and whatsapp groups, live chats. Plenty of people happy to help you out. A level customer support that is unmatched.     <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although we have a set of guidelines that we follow while working on our technology that does not mean that you as a <a href=\"\/aero\/supplier-distribution-kits\">distributor partner<\/a> or as a customer have to honor or even follow these guidelines. And while you have to take care of not violating open source licenses on which sparvk is built , as a user of you are free to do with it as you please. <\/p>\n<h1>Are you ready?<\/h1>"},{"title":"Supplier distribution kits","date_published":"2018-12-26","date_modified":"2018-12-26","id":"http:\/\/sparvk.workrock.in\/aero\/supplier-distribution-kits","url":"http:\/\/sparvk.workrock.in\/aero\/supplier-distribution-kits","author":{"name":"Your Name"},"content_html":"\n<p>At sparvk we are committed to enabling our suppliers with the highest quality of products to help them provide the best service to their customers.   <\/p>\n<p>Since sparvk is a portable distribution of  opensource operating systems it is highly configurable.

Sometimes because of something you did and sometimes due to no fault of your own. No matter how careful you are. No matter how many precautions you take. <\/p>\n<p>There are many causes of hardware failure. A corrupted hard drive. A fault in motherboard. A dead memory. Inadequate power supply.<\/p>\n<p>Harddrive failures are the costliest of them all. Although a hard disk is one of the cheapest parts of a computer and yet it is one that is most precious to you. After all, all your data, the hard work of so many years is contained inside the hard disk. You can replace the motherborad. Buy your self a new RAM. Fix the CPU fan. But once the data in the hard disk is lost it can be very difficult to get it back. <\/p>\n<p>Data backup and archival is something that you should be doing a regular basis. There are many strategies for data backup. <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can put it up on the cloud. And download it back when you need it.<\/li>\n<li>You can create your own NFS and have a central repository for your data. <\/li>\n<li>You can backup the data on physical disks keeping multiple copies for each one. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Although they are the most convenient method of the 3 strategies cloud backups can get expensive in the long term. As the volume and the access to your data increases your costs tend to increase.\n<img alt=\"opensource operating systems on a harddrive\" src=\"\/images\/9\/0\/3\/1\/5\/903156478d73f9b04f8d00f21b12fae9c11097b5-computer-1574533960720.jpeg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To reduce the costs of your cloud backups you can set up your own FTP server. Although the initial costs will be high over a period of time you\u2019ll get both the convenience of online backups as well as cost reductions of an in house solution. But to keep such a system running you\u2019d have to spend maintenance costs which depending upon the complexity of your requirements might be minimal or huge. It is not advisable to run an in house server unless you have the required technical expertise. <\/p>\n<p>Cloud backups and setting up your own NFS servers are both examples of online data backups. Where your storage is always available and you can access your data as long as you\u2019re connected to the network. But what if you don\u2019t have a network access? Or what if the network access is too slow for the volume of data you need? <\/p>\n<p>In that case offline backups are the best solution. A physical harddrive is one of the most effective investments you can make to keep your data safe. You can use the hard disks in a couple of ways. You can either <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use one disk per workstation. <\/li>\n<li>Or you can use a single disk across a number of workstations. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The effort required to back up the data is minimal. All you need to do is connect the disk and run the backup program on your computer. <\/p>\n<p>It is also a good idea to set a life expectancy to each of the disks that you use on your workstations. For example you may retire a disk after 3 years or after 5 years. Retiring a disk does not mean that you throw it away. It simply means that you no longer write on to this disk and keep it as a read only archive. Something that can be used to lookup an old copy of an important file. <\/p>\n<p>A harddrive that is not being written to\/ not being modified can last for decades. Long enough time for you to extract all the value you can out of your data. After which point you may redeploy these systems into computing tasks that don\u2019t require you to store  any sensitive data. Or example customer support machines where your staff has to respond to inquires from your customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Offline standby systems<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Data loss is one cause of concern when it comes to dealing with disk failures. Another problem is loss of equipment for the duration it takes to restore the original workstation. <\/p>\n<p>There is a better way. By creating ready to boot harddrives you can have multiple copies of a running operating system that can be integrated in any workstation. You can switch harddrives when one fails. You can retire old hard drives early. You can set up new machines quickly and reduce the <a href=\"\/home\/reducing-your-it-costs-with-sparvk-pods\">total cost of ownership<\/a> of your IT systems. So that you can expand your IT infrastructure on demand. <\/p>\n<p>Sparvk aero can help you create offline \u201cavailable\u201d systems so your production never stops. <\/p>\n<h1>Are you ready?<\/h1>"}]}
