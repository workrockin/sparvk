                        <p>USB drives are not the only secondary storage medium in the market.  Alternatives like secure disk cards are quite popular. If you use a smart phone you are probably already  using a micro sd card. You&rsquo;d also be using an SD card if you own let us say a digital camera or maybe a smart TV. Although sd cards were initially designed to provide a compact form of storage in smaller devices these days the SD card slot is pretty common even in laptops and desktops. </p><p>In the last couple of posts we&rsquo;ve d...</p>

To further clarify a boot device is different from the BIOS firmware unit that comes installed on the hardware. </p><p>For most computers th...</p>

                        <p>As we talked about in our last article <a href="/home/what-happens-when-you-turn-on-your-computer">booting a computer</a> is a very straightforward process. So simple in-fact that most of the time you don&rsquo;t even realize that its happening. All you do is press the power button and up comes the screen. </p><p>When you press that power button you set in motion a series of events. First the OEM installed BIOS makes the hardware components available to a computer. The device then tries to find a bootloader on a disk (either a hard disk or an external device like us...</p>

                        <p>sparvk provides you with various tools to help you manage your photographs. At the file level it enables you to arrange all your photos in directories. By default sparvk comes with a Pictures directory. As the name suggests the Pictures directory is meant to function as your digital photo album. Here you can create subdirectories to file your photos in multiple albums. For example there can be a family album that keeps all the photos of your family members. There can be a  holiday album keeping...</p>

                        <p>When you press the power button on your computer it starts a series process collectively known as booting. Initially only a part of ROM storage is accessible to the computer. A small firmware program (BIOS) located on the ROM runs to perform a POST (power on self test) preparing the computer to access other parts of its hardware like ram and hard disk. </p><p>Following the POST setup a "bootstrap" loader is invoked to load the operating system kernel. The operating system kernel in turn runs a serie...</p>

                        <p>Organization of the data on your computer requires discipline and consistency.
But often due to a tight schedule "housekeeping" gets de-prioritized. Things pile
up. Files accumulate. Folders stack on and before you know it your desktop is a
mess like your store in the basement. But while you can simply ignore your basement you have
to work with your desktop daily. </p><p>Every-time you power on your computer you step
in to disorder, chaos. You can't say for sure if your resume is placed in "new
